## Last Week's Accomplishments
I've become a lot more comfortable with my Ubuntu virtual machine, which is great. I am now in more direct conversation with Ken than ever and I'm essentially following what he says to do message by message. Once all the servers were up, I had an issue with getting AGENCY to connect with the postgres server. That was resolved once I realized I was using the wrong password for the database. Now, I am awaiting instructions on how to remove or pause email features, which the incomplete setup of it (complete setup requires a separate download and it is not necessary yet) is causing the overall service to start.

With that, I haven't gotten to full documentation and installation notes yet. But, I am close to setting up this service and I cannot wait to write up on it and share it with the rest of the team.

## This Week's Plan
Reaaaaally finish installation and get it all documented. I also want to touch base with the rest of the team and see what they've been up to while I figured out AGENCY setup.

## Anything Blocking?
Very minor things that are being resolved message-by-message. It's a matter of waiting for Ken.
