## Last Week's Accomplishments
I finished documenting, to the highest amount that I can, the installation process (so far) of the AGENCY software. I as well documented at what state this process leaves the user. Specifically, at the log-in screen with errors and the inability to log in with the user defaults. Furthermore, I worked on the group presentation in anticipation of 4/23. I highlighted what the Implementation team attempted to do and what we ran into.

## This Week's Plan
This project did not go well. And it has made me upset. After the presentation, I wish to write in a Markdown file and in my final status update why this project is not worth pursuing. From the outdated and ugly user interface, to the poor file structure and numerous, yet all failing variations of installation documentation. Also the lack of faith Ken had in us students, ghosting us completely. Despite learning some things, I did not enjoy my time in RCOS. I do have optimism for the Creation subdivision of the AGENCY project who are making their own product from scratch and with their full control. So, I would suggest future members to work on this and not on AGENCY proper. (This also calls for a team rebrand).

So, I will write about this experience one way or another and bring some closure to this project.

## Anything Blocking?
Same things as every week before this one.
