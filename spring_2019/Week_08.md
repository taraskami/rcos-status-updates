## Last Week's Accomplishments
A very much appreciated breakthrough in the AGENCY installation. Does not seem that I got rid of the errors from the email client, but now I am given an option to bypass that and go to AGENCY's login screen. This is a first. So, that's great! But, I try and log in with the default credentials and I cannot get in. I'll see how I can get in, and once I do, that'll be the biggest achievement.

Again, I did not reach our team's overall goal for the semester, but being able to reach a point where I can hand the project to someone else for them to do what I couldn't would be just as well. Especially since I plan on doing RCOS in the Fall (but likely for no credit, and just to assist others in the team to get the product installed).

The silence from Ken is concerning, though. And seeing how well the other members of the team are doing in their own products, AGENCY might be dead to us after this semester. Further talks will determine that.

## This Week's Plan
Try and log into AGENCY and finally get to the homepage. Document, document, document. Communicate with the rest of the team on the fate of AGENCY.

## Anything Blocking?
Lack of communication with Ken, and the rest of the team. Default credentials to AGENCY do not work.

## Notes
I forgot to push this week's status update on Friday. I hope that can be forgiven.
