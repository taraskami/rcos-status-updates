# Final status update

The project has concluded, as the presentation was given on Tuesday. To wrap things up, I'd like to provide a summary of this semester at RCOS:

For my first semester in RCOS, I joined AGENCY, a new project created by Professor Goldschmidt. The initial motivation for this project was to take AGENCY, an existing open-sourced software created by Ken Tanzer, and implement it to the Albany Public Library. The purpose of AGENCY is to keep track of a non-profit organization's resources and stakeholders. The APL requested a new method of keeping track of those who are banned or suspended from the libraries, so AGENCY was deemed fit to do so.

The team initially all worked together to try and set up AGENCY. The overall idea was to first have it working on our local machines and then implement it onto a server for which the APL could use. However, after some struggle, the team chose to split. I was still dedicated to implementing AGENCY, for it had worked on other machines before and there would be no reason for me to fail setting it up. Others in the team started a new product from scratch.

Every few days I'd try to proceed setting up AGENCY, and when I would hit a major roadblock I'd have to start over again. For a while I'd consult Ken about error messages and how to get around them. but at some point he stopped answering my questions. When that occurred, I lost faith in the project.

So, this project did not go amazingly for me. However, I did learn Postgres. I made some open-source contribution by documenting the installation process for as far as I could go, so that if anyone in our RCOS group were to pick this project up again they could get through some parts of the installation faster than I did. I hope this quantity of open-source contribution will suffice given the poor quality of this project.
