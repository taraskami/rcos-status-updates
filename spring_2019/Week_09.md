## Last Week's Accomplishments
Very little. After uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times, and trying to change the parameters for the default password, I cannot log in. The end of the semester is here, and I cannot get this thing set up. And now with the absence of Ken and the lack of communication from the rest of the team, this project feels dead to me.

## This Week's Plan
Wrap up documentation and write about the current state that I am witnessing. Practice our presentation with the team and discuss how this project will continue later on.

## Anything Blocking?
Cannot log into AGENCY, lack of time as semester ends, and no more communication within team and from Ken.
