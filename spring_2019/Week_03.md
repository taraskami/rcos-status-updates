## Last Week's Accomplishments

I've come to realize that using WSL is a bust. It is not fully functional and isn't meant for a large-scale project. Postgres doesn't work properly on it, and it produces issues that are WSL specific and there are no solutions for it. I've got it to mostly work on the Windows command prompt, but I think using an Ubuntu dual-boot will be necessary.

Furthermore, we had a successful meeting today. We talked about what steps are necessary, and regrouped ourselves to be more effective. We mostly assured ourselves that it's okay to take a step back, learn our respective material, and think about the client first, rather than going hard on "installing AGENCY" per the instructions. I believe doing this will let us become more comfortable with the project, as well as taking some PHP and Postgres knowledge in. After all, that's what RCOS is about, learning new things.

## This Week's Plan

I'll practice PHP skills and try to be comfortable with developing my own little site before trying to establish AGENCY. I'd still like to try this week, though. I need to continue exploring which environment is best, most likely an Ubuntu dual-boot. That's a project in itself, not necessarily that its hard but it takes time.

We want to organize a call with Ken too, so I will need to create an agenda and make sure our time is effective.

## Anything Blocking?

As stated above, mainly issues with installation once again. This time around it is lack of PHP knowledge and WSL being a poor environment. We discovered in the meeting that once we do get AGENCY working, it may be difficult to modify PHP code to our liking. So, difficulty of the code is soon to be another blocker.

## Notes
In a thinking-out-loud way, I wrote in the wiki of my personal AGENCY repo about the various environments that could be used, as well as each necessary component and at what state they are in terms of knowledge, implementation, and installation.
