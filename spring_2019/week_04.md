## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the bulk of this week, not a lot happened. This is due to a hectic midterms week and the fact that our project at the moment has oriented to learning rather than application. Some housekeeping is being done, though, as we called Ken (Creator of AGENCY, in case I haven't mentioned that before) earlier today.

## This Week's Plan

This upcoming week is Spring Break, so who knows how much time I'll get to do much. I think I will continue this learning approach to master PHP development and how to set up a proper server, whether it be a legitimate one or on localhost. When I return, however, I'd like to meet up with a member on our team who has an achievement opposite to my own: He has a PHP server set up on his local machine, but can't get AGENCY installed because he doesn't know much about Postgres. We could combine our knowledge and very well get something working. I am looking forward to that.

There is discussion on creating a quick, temporary solution for APL, but personally I am very unconcerned about that. I am contributing to the team and trying my best but ultimately I am trying to learn new skills and my ultimate goal is to shape and implement a project as large and established as AGENCY. This is why I am working for that subteam.

## Anything Blocking?

As said above, the only blocker this week was lack of time. Nothing computer-specific because, well, little was done to begin with.
