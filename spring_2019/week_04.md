## Last Week's Accomplishments

For the bulk of this week, not a lot happened. This is due to a hectic midterms week and the fact that our project at the moment has oriented to learning rather than application. Some housekeeping is being done, though, as we called Ken (Creator of AGENCY, in case I haven't mentioned that before) earlier today.

The call went mostly well. Due to the lack of work done this week, there were no specifics that were talked about, mainly just stating where the project is at the moment. Ken gave a few pointers on how to successfully get this project up and running, like that a Linux setup is highly recommended. Also, too understand how this project has been set up by others, turns out Ken hosts all but one of his clients' servers. The one client is hosting it on their own using CentOS.

Ken also suggests that while PHP and Postgres knowledge is good to have, being a master in the languages are not necessary to navigate the code. He said that the tables aren't extensive, and the .php files don't contain so much PHP code itself. So really, the step I need to figure out is how to get a server up and running.

## This Week's Plan

This upcoming week is Spring Break, so who knows how much time I'll get to do much. I think I will continue this learning approach to master PHP development and how to set up a proper server, whether it be a legitimate one or on localhost. When I return, however, I'd like to meet up with a member on our team who has an achievement opposite to my own: He has a PHP server set up on his local machine, but can't get AGENCY installed because he doesn't know much about Postgres. We could combine our knowledge and very well get something working. I am looking forward to that.

There is discussion on creating a quick, temporary solution for APL, but personally I am very unconcerned about that. I am contributing to the team and trying my best but ultimately I am trying to learn new skills and my ultimate goal is to shape and implement a project as large and established as AGENCY. This is why I am working for that subteam.

## Anything Blocking?

As said above, the only blocker this week was lack of time. Nothing computer-specific because, well, little was done to begin with.
