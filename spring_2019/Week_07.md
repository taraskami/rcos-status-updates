## Last Week's Accomplishments
Very little accomplishments. Ken never got back to me, so I don't know how to properly debug this mail error. I have a couple ideas to DROP whatever it inserted into the database, but if that fails I will figure out at what point those features are installed and comment them out when doing a reinstall. There are only 4 weeks left in the semester and it's embarrassing that I could not have this figured out quickly enough. Then again, it feels like I am the only one even trying to do this, and it is a complicated thing to set up if it's my first time. Couple those with the fact I'm implementing complex code from someone who does not communicate with me as often as I'd like, and I guess my position is valid.

I went ahead and documented my installation process on the GitHub wiki, in hopes that if anyone chooses to join this project in future semesters will be able to install this more quickly and make progress. Although considering that a good chunk of the team has opted to create a new product from scratch, I don't even know the longevity of AGENCY in APL.

Oh well. This is open source, and I'm making a contribution nonetheless.

## This Week's Plan
As I mentioned above, I will try and get rid of those mail errors by either uninstalling the features or by reinstalling AGENCY as a whole with those features blocked out somehow. I'll also continue working on documentation and prepare for our upcoming presentation (I believe on 4/23).

## Anything Blocking?
As I mentioned above again, lack of communication is making me not able to resolve some issues. I have ways that may fix the problems, but it's either experimental or simple.
