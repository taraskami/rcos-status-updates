## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.

> This past week, I was able to implement the the dialog box for creating a new user in the front end. I \
> learned how to send requests in JavaScript to the backend API.

> I organized our documentation and note-taking necessary for our group project. This will help us remain focused and know what we must do and by when. Furthermore, I am going through the steps of installing AGENCY, as well as Postgres and PHP, on my computer, and it is mostly done. 

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.

> After my accomplishments from last week, I plan to add accessibility features to the user creation dialog box. \
> I also plan on attending the git workshop this week.

I am looking to finish installation of all the components, and document how I did it to help the rest of the team get there. Once I can get on? I want to fruther clarify what we want our product to do and have, and play around with the code to see how that can be achieved. We are making a trip to Albany next week to understand the APL's current system, its pros and cons, and how to transfer.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> I don't know how to test the accessibility features I am going to be implementing this week, so i am going to \
> ask my mentors if they have any suggestions.

A general blocker for the team is lack of knowledge of Postgres and PHP, and even Linux for some. So, various tutorials, Stack Overflow searches, and more were necessary to figure something out. The READMEs are slightly confusing, so trial and error was necessary. I wouldn't say there is anything blocking me personally, except that this weekend was busy with other coursework and the Career Fair so I couldn't advance as far as I wanted in this project.

## Notes
