## Contributions and Documentation

AGENCY was an untraditional project in that before contributions could be made commit-wise, installation of the service must be done. Because of this, contributions are unfortunately not being tracked in the usual commit/merge/milestone way, but rather through a series of documents in a Google Drive folder.

I hope that this serves as enough proof that I made "meaningful contributions to several milestones" and that I "[communicated] failures and development barriers to their team and mentors and documents them for the future, and [made my] best effort to overcome", per the rubric.
